# Key Contributions

- Spearheading integration as a **senior technical lead** for CAD and Simulations but with involvement in propulsion, hydraulics, and electronics.
- Personally responsible for passing **20+ mechanical safety checks** with physical testing, FEA and calculations for regulatory compliance in the attended **2024 competition.** Also supported in the 2023 competition through a Virtual Desktop Instance (VDI) to run simulations remotely.
- Proficient in **Fusion 360** for detailed 3D modeling of critical TBM components.
- Utilised **Abaqus** for stress analysis, conducted static structural simulations for cutterhead, tunnel lining, lifting load case, shield etc. and dynamic explicit simulations for cutterhead on soil.
- Involvement in marketing, setting up **automated** email marketing campaigns and lead generation, directing sale of old equipment for **fundraising.**
- Managing documentation such as **bill of materials (BoM),** inventory management and **master CAD model**. Created full inventory list with images.

# Responsibilities

- Collaborated cross-functionally between teams to incorporate CAD models into our TBM.
- Conducted **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** simulations to assess structural integrity, performance, and adequate safety index.
- Provided simulation-driven recommendations to improve TBM components.

# Team Achievements

- **Top 6 Global Finalists** in Elon Musk's Not-a-Boring competition 2023.
- Achieved impressive results since its founding in 2021, improving competition rankings year on year.

# Skills Developed

- **Autodesk Fusion 360**
- **Abaqus**
- **CAD / CAM**
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**
