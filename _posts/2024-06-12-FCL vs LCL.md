Less than Container Load and Full Container Load are very important options in cost-effective logistics in global shipping. In an effort to reduce Warwick Tunnel Boring's shipping costs a full 20ft container is around £ 8,000 of ocean freight both ways and around £ 12,000 with air freight on the way there. As opposed to using LCL prices could be as low as £ 2,000 - 3,000 for two pallets which is enough to bring front-end, electrical cabinets and pneumatic / soil hoses.

### What is LCL Shipping?
LCL means the space in the container is shared with other shippers. It's cost-effective for small shipments, but the transit times are longer because of consolidation. Although it is flexible, LCL does increase the risk of damage as cargo mixes with other people's goods. Palletising to EUR1 120cm x 80cm pallets or other may be required. Shipping larger than standard pallets is considerably more expensive. Note that the use of non ISPM 15 certified fire-treated pallets may incur fines particularly when shipping to the US.

### What is FCL Shipping?
FCL offers a container for your exclusive use, best suited for larger shipments. It offers speedier transit, better security, and lower cost per unit when a container is fully utilized. It is, however, more expensive and less practical if one has smaller loads. Warwick Boring / Warwick Tunnel Boring has used a 20ft container for the 2024 competition.

### Choice between LCL and FCL
- **Volume of Shipment**: Use LCL for small loads and FCL for near-full containers.
- **Urgency**: FCL is faster because it does not face consolidation delays.
- **Budget**: LCL is cheaper for small cargo but risks higher indirect costs from delays or damage.
- **Cargo Type**: FCL suits fragile or high-value goods because of minimal handling.

### Conclusion
LCL provides flexibility to smaller shipments, while FCL offers speed and security for larger volumes. Assess your shipment size, timeline, and budget to decide the best fit for your logistics strategy.
